## Milestone 1 — Card builder `feature`

- [ ] Card settings step: name, size (3×3 / 5×5), free-space toggle, order (random / set)
- [ ] Square entry UI: add labels, choose type (check / counter), set counter goal
- [ ] Random layout: shuffle squares into fixed `position`s once, at creation
- [ ] Persist card + squares via a Server Action, with validation (label count matches grid)
- [ ] Free-space handling: reserve the center cell and mark it pre-complete
- [ ] Edit a card and its squares after creation (fully editable)
- [ ] Delete a card (with confirmation)

## Milestone 2 — Play & track `feature`

- [ ] Responsive card play view: render the grid, mobile-first
- [ ] Check squares: toggle complete/incomplete and log the completion

- [ ] Completion history: view entries and edit `completedAt`
- [ ] Dashboard card list: show progress summary and open a card

## Milestone 3 — Bingo & celebration `feature`
